## Introduction & Aim
  ADVAN-style analytical solutions for 1, 2, 3 compartment linear pharmacokinetic models of intravenous bolus, infusion,
and first-order absorption have been derived and published by [Abuhelwa et al., 2015](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25841670). The analytical solutions are used to simulate the time-course of drug amounts in the compartments of a pharmacokinetic models and they “advance” the solution of the model from one time point to the next, allowing for any dose or time-varying covariate factors to be accounted for. The ADVAN-style analytical solutions were coded in the R programming language (2) and have been shown to have speed advantages over solutions using differential equation solvers (1). The aims of this study were to enhance the computational speed of the ADVAN-style analytical functions for faster simulation processing, present the ADVAN-style analytical functions in an R package, “PKADVAN” package, and make them available for the wider audience, and expand the “PKADVAN” package library to include other pharmacokinetic models such as transit first-order absorption and metabolite models.

## Aims
The aims of this study were to:

  - enhance the performance and increase the computational speed for the ADVAN-style analytical solutions through coding the
ADVAN-style analytical functions in a hybrid R/C++ programming
languages.
  - To present them in an R package to make them available for the wider audience to be utilized for various
applications.

## Methods
ADVAN-style analytical solutions were written in the C++ programming language and were integrated in R using
the Rcpp package attributes (3). The integrated R/C++ ADVAN-style analytical solutions were then made into an open-source
R package (“PKADVAN”) using RStudio. To assess computational speed, simulations for 1000 subjects using three compartment
IV bolus, infusion, and first-order absorption models were performed and compared to relative computational speed of the
equivalent compiled/uncompiled R-coded functions published by Abuhelwa et al. (1). For each subject, two doses were
simulated with the evaluations performed at 1 hour time intervals for 2 days.

## Results
Simulations using the integrated R/C++ ADVAN-style analytical solutions performed substantially faster than
the equivalent R-coded functions. The integrated R/C++ functions simulated data for 1000 subjects in ~1 second, which was
23 26 times faster than the equivalent R-coded functions. The relative speed of the integrated R/C++ functions was greater
with the more complex models and with more extensive sample time evaluations. For example, simulations from the
3 compartment IV infusion model using the integrated R/C++ function were ~46 times faster than the R-coded function
when the same dosing regimen simulations were extended for 5 days. The integrated R/C++ functions for 1, 2, 3 compartment
IV bolus, infusion, and first-order absorption models are presented in the “PKADVAN” package which can be downloaded
from GitHub.

##Conclusion
A main application for the integrated R/C++ functions is for simulation from stochastic population
pharmacokinetic models coded in R and incorporated into reactive Shiny Web applications (4).
The speed of the integrated R/C++ analytical solutions is important here as they allow for simulating larger
populations (e.g. 1000 subjects) without compromising the speed and the reactivity benefits of the Shiny application.
The integrated R/C++ functions could be incorporated into an open-source mixed-effect modelling framework to estimate
population parameters where speed is always desirable.  With their capacity to handle complex dosing regimens and
covariate structures, the “PKADVAN” package is expected to facilitate the investigation of useful open-source software
for modelling and simulating pharmacokinetic data.
